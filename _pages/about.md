Hi, my name is Siddharth, and I am a 5th year PhD student at IIT Kharagpur, in the Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, working towards auditing user-interfaced AI software like Face Recognition Systems and e-commerce platforms to identify and mitigate biases against minority stakeholders, with Prof. [Animesh Mukherjee](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/). I was a PMRF (Prime Minister's Research Fellowship) scholar from January 2022 to January 2025. 

In another lifetime, I was a Technical Project Lead at Huawei Technologies, India, working with the Cloud & AI team on Big Databases, focusing on query optimization and database connectors.

I completed my M.Tech(Research) degree from Dept of [CDS](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/), [IISc](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru, India. During my time at IISc, I was associated with DREAM Lab, working on distributed graph algorithms. I also received the Microsoft Data Science Fellowship for the duration of my degree. 

I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engg in 2016 from [Tezpur Central University](http://www.tezu.ernet.in/), Tezpur, Assam, India. 

I play football and volleyball and am a huge supporter of Manchester United FC. I like photography, reading books and writing poetry. Albert Camus, Ruskin Bond and Khaled Hosseini are some of the authors whose works I love.
